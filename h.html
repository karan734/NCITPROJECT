        <h1> <u>It's Features</u></h1> 
        <p>The special features of the Bugatti W-16 engine are amazing. For example:

            The engine has four valves per cylinder, for a total of 64 valves.
            It has a dry sump lubrication system borrowed from Formula 1 race cars, along with an intricate internal oil path to ensure proper lubrication and cooling within the 16 cylinders.
            It has electronically controlled, continuously variable cam timing to create optimal performance at different engine rpm settings.</p>

        <p>Everything about the engine is superlative.

            And it is remarkably compact. It measures just 710 mm (27 inches) long, 889 mm (35 inches) wide and 730 mm (28.7 inches) high. This is the beauty of Bugatti's W-16 approach -- the engineers managed to fit 1,000 hp into a reasonably sized package.
            
            In order to harness all of this horsepower and torque, you need an amazing transmission...</p>
