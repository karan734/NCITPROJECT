            <p>The Bugatti Chiron is a mid-engine two-seater sports car designed
                 and developed in Germany by Bugatti Engineering GmbH[7] and manufactured 
                 in Molsheim, France, by French automobile manufacturer Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. 
                 The successor to the Bugatti Veyron,[8] the Chiron was first shown at the Geneva
                  Motor Show on 1 March 2016.[9][10] The car's design was initially previewed with 
                  the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept car unveiled at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show.[11]</p> <br> <br>

            <p>The main carry over component from the Veyron is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L; 487.8 cu in) quad-turbocharged
                 W16 engine, though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Chiron has a peak power 
                 output of 1,103.25 kW (1,479 hp; 1,500 PS) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of
                  torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm.[13] The engine in the most powerful variant 
                  of its predecessor, the Veyron Super Sport generates 221 kW (296 hp; 300 PS) less than
                   the new Chiron, while the engine in the original Veyron generates 367 kW (492 hp; 499 PS)
                    less power.[14][15]</p> <br> <br>

            <p>The Veyron’s reign as the world fastest production car is at an end, and the usurper comes from within. Yes, the £1.9m Chiron retains the Veyron’s fundamental proportions and powertrain,
                but it’s new in every other conceivable way, and built to bend physics to breaking point.</p> <br> <br>

            <p>The interior of the car is upholstered in blue Alcantara and also has the 
                colours of the French flag present on the headrests of the seats, on the back of the seats and on
                 top of the steering wheel. Production will be limited to 20 units.</p> <br> <br>

            <p>At the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, Bugatti unveiled the track focused version of the Chiron,
                 named the Chiron Sport. Mechanically the car is identical to the regular version,
                  generating 1,500 PS (1,105 kW; 1,480 hp) from a quad-turbocharged W16 engine
                   but is 18 kg (40 lb) lighter due to the extensive use of carbon fibre and 
                   has a stiffer suspension in order to increase the cornering ability of the car
                    while maintaining its grand touring characteristics. </p>
