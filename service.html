            <p>For starters, a base-model Veyron cost approximately $1.7 million when new, with models typically
                 running between that and a whopping $3 million. According to Khoshbin,his stunning
                  brown-on-brown 1,200-horsepower Legend-series Veyron Roadster cost him over</p> <br> <br>
           
            <img src="s1.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="25%">
              <p>Bugatti recommends changing all of the Veyron's fluids annually to the tune of about $25,000, partially because of the 16 drain plugs involved to do so. 
                This Veyron has twice as many plugs to open up than on the Lamborghini Hurac√°n,
                 according to Motor1.</p> <br> <br>
            
            
                <img src="s6.jpg" alt="" width="100%" height="25%"> 
              <p>All this adds up to a ton of cash every two years or so, provided you rack up 10,000 miles in that timespan. 
                Including the wheels, you're looking at $113,000 over 24 months</p> <br> <br>
